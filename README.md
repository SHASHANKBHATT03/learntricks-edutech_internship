# learntricks-edutech_internship

 This repository contains my project progress during one month ML internship at Learntricks edutech 

 During this internship ,I was sucessfully able to create a clustering model on iris flower classifiaction using K Means clustering 

 K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. 

To know more about K means clustrering you may refer to this aarticle :

  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/k-means-clustering-introduction/


The dataset used here in thsis project is the IRIS FLOWER DATASET 

The dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width and Class(Species).
This dataset is free and is publicly available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository

For easily access , i have used the folowing version of the smae availble on kaggle :

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset


For easy execution of  the code  you may download the dataset in your local system and change the following path to the respective directory path :

iris = pd.read_csv("../input/iris-flower-dataset/IRIS.csv")   # change this path 

To run this code you may also go to the new notebook option avaialbe at the dataset link page and have a fresh start 


Thank you
